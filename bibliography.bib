Using the Voronoi diagram of the input point set, we deduce a tensor field whose principal axes and eccentricities locally represent respectively the most likely direction of the normal to the surface, and the confidence in this direction estimation. An implicit function is then computed by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem such that its gradient is most aligned with the principal axes of the tensor field, providing a best-fitting isosurface reconstruction. Our approach possesses a number of distinguishing features. In particular, the implicit function optimization provides resilience to noise, adjustable fitting to the data, and controllable smoothness of the reconstructed surface. Finally, the use of simplicial meshes (possibly restricted to a thin crust around the input data) and (an)isotropic Laplace operators renders the numerical treatment simple and robust.},

  abstract = {The power crust is a construction which takes a sample of points from the surface of a three-dimensional object and produces a surface mesh and an approximate medial axis. The approach is to first approximate the medial axis transform (MAT) of the object. We then use an inverse transform to produce the surface representation from the MAT. This idea leads to a simple algorithm with theoretical guarantees comparable to those of other surface reconstruction and medial axis approximation algorithms. It also comes with a guarantee that does not depend in any way on the quality of the input point sample. Any input gives an output surface which is the `watertight' boundary of a three-dimensional polyhedral solid: the solid described by the approximate MAT. This unconditional guarantee makes the algorithm quite robust and eliminates the polygonalization, hole-filling or manifold extraction post-processing steps required in previous surface reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we use the theory to develop a power crust implementation which is indeed robust for realistic and even difficult samples. We describe the careful design of a key subroutine which labels parts of the MAT as inside or outside of the object, easy in theory but non-trivial in practice. We find that we can handle areas in which the input sampling is scanty or noisy by simply discarding the unreliable parts of the MAT approximation. We demonstrate good empirical results on inputs including models with sharp corners, sparse and unevenly distributed point samples, holes, and noise, both natural and synthetic. We also demonstrate some simple extensions: intentionally leaving holes where there is no data, producing approximate offset surfaces, and simplifying the approximate MAT in a principled way to preserve stable features.},

The traditional problem addressed by surface reconstruction is to recover the digital representation of a physical shape that has been scanned, where the scanned data contains a wide variety of defects. While much of the earlier work has been focused on reconstructing a piece-wise smooth representation of the original shape, recent work has taken on more specialized priors to address significantly challenging data imperfections, where the reconstruction can take on different representations - not necessarily the explicit geometry. This state-of-the-art report surveys the field of surface reconstruction, providing a categorization with respect to priors, data imperfections, and reconstruction output. By considering a holistic view of surface reconstruction, this report provides a detailed characterization of the field, highlights similarities between diverse reconstruction techniques, and provides directions for future work in surface reconstruction.},

Notably, Sibson proposed the so-called natural neighbor coordinates that are defined from the Voronoi diagram of the sample points. A drawback of those coordinate systems is that their definition domain is restricted to the convex hull of the sample points. This makes them difficult to use when the sample points belong to a surface. To overcome this diffculty, we propose a new system of coordinates. Given a closed surface S, i.e. a (d-1)-manifold of Rd, the coordinate system is defined everywhere on the surface, is continuous, and is local even if the sampling density is finite. Moreover, it is inherently (d-1)-dimensional while the previous systems are d-dimensional. No assumption is made about the ordering, the connectivity or topology of the sample points nor of the surface. We illustrate our results with an application to interpolation over a surface.},

The input to our algorithm is a point sample coming from an unknown manifold. Our approach is based on two main ideas: the notion of tangential Delaunay complex defined in Boissonnat and Fl\"ototto (Comput. Aided Des. 36:161\textendash 174, 2004), Fl\"ototto (A coordinate system associated to a point cloud issued from a manifold: definition, properties and applications. Ph.D. thesis, 2003), Freedman (IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 24(10), 2002), and the technique of sliver removal by weighting the sample points (Cheng et al. in J. ACM 47:883\textendash 904, 2000). Differently from previous methods, we do not construct any subdivision of the d-dimensional ambient space. As a result, the running time of our algorithm depends only linearly on the extrinsic dimension d while it depends quadratically on the size of the input sample, and exponentially on the intrinsic dimension k. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first certified algorithm for manifold reconstruction whose complexity depends linearly on the ambient dimension. We also prove that for a dense enough sample the output of our algorithm is isotopic to the manifold and a close geometric approximation of the manifold.},

Specifically, we introduce a multilevel streaming representation, which enables efficient traversal of a sparse octree by concurrently advancing through multiple streams, one per octree level. Remarkably, for our reconstruction application, a sufficiently accurate solution to the global linear system is obtained using a single iteration of cascadic multigrid, which can be evaluated within a single multi-stream pass. We demonstrate scalable performance on several large datasets.},

The goal of this thesis is to improve the visualizations performed by engineers by taking into account the characteristics of the human visual perception, with a particular focus on the perception of space and volume during the visualization of dense 3D data. Firstly, three psychophysics experiments have shown that direct volume rendering, a technique relying on the ordered accumulation of transparencies, provide very ambiguous cues to depth. This is particularly true for static presentations, while the addition of motion and exaggerated perspective cues help to solve part of these difficulties. Then, two algorithms have been developed to improve depth perception during the visualization of complex 3D structures. They have been implemented on the GPU, to achieve interactive renderings independently of the geometric nature of the analysed data. EyeDome Lighting is a new non-photorealistic shading technique that relies on the projected depth image of the scene. This algorithm enhances the perception of shapes and relative depths in complex 3D scenes. Also, a new fast view-dependent cutaway technique has been implemented, which permits to access otherwise occluded objects while providing cues to understand the structure in depth of masking objects.},

We introduce a new kinetic framework that hides to its user the combinatorial complexity of determining or maintaining the polyhedron topology, allowing the design of a simple variational optimization. This new kinetic framework allows the manipulation of a bounded polyhedron with simple faces by specifying the target plane equations of each of its faces. It proceeds by evolving continuously from the polyhedron defined by its initial topology and its initial plane equations to a polyhedron that is as topologically close as possible to the initial polyhedron but with the new plane equations. This kinetic framework handles internally the necessary topological changes that may be required to keep the faces simple and the polyhedron bounded. For each intermediate configurations where the polyhedron looses the simplicity of its faces or its boundedness, the simplest topological modification that is able to reestablish the simplicity and the boundedness is performed.},

An object's surface is defined implicitly as the zero set of an RBF fitted to the given surface data. Fast methods for fitting and evaluating RBFs allow us to model large data sets, consisting of millions of surface points, by a single RBF \textemdash{} previously an impossible task. A greedy algorithm in the fitting process reduces the number of RBF centers required to represent a surface and results in significant compression and further computational advantages. The energy-minimisation characterisation of polyharmonic splines result in a ``smoothest'' interpolant. This scale-independent characterisation is well-suited to reconstructing surfaces from non-uniformly sampled data. Holes are smoothly filled and surfaces smoothly extrapolated. We use a non-interpolating approximation when the data is noisy. The functional representation is in effect a solid model, which means that gradients and surface normals can be determined analytically. This helps generate uniform meshes and we show that the RBF representation has advantages for mesh simplification and remeshing applications. Results are presented for real-world rangefinder data.},

As many algorithms of this kind, it produces a piecewise linear approximation of a surface S from a finite, sufficiently dense, subset of its points. Originally, the starting point of this work does not come from the computational geometry field. It is inspired by an existing numerical scheme of surface convection developed by Zhao, Osher and Fedkiw. We have translated this scheme to make it depend on the geometry of the input data set only, and not on the precision of some grid around the surface. Our algorithm deforms a closed oriented pseudo-surface embedded in the 3D Delaunay triangulation of the sampled points, and the reconstructed surface consists of a set of oriented facets located in this 3D Delaunay triangulation. This paper provides an appropriate data structure to represent a pseudo-surface, together with operations that manage deformations and topological changes. The algorithm can handle surfaces with boundaries, surfaces of high genus and, unlike most of the other existing schemes, it does not involve a global heuristic. Its complexity is that of the 3D Delaunay triangulation of the points. We present some results of the method, which turns out to be efficient even on noisy input data.},

While mode detection is done by a standard graph-based hill-climbing scheme, the novelty of our approach resides in its use of               topological persistence               to guide the merging of clusters. Our algorithm provides additional feedback in the form of a set of points in the plane, called a               persistence diagram               (PD), which provably reflects the prominences of the modes of the density. In practice, this feedback enables the user to choose relevant parameter values, so that under mild sampling conditions the algorithm will output the               correct               number of clusters, a notion that can be made formally sound within persistence theory. In addition, the output clusters have the property that their spatial locations are bound to the ones of the basins of attraction of the peaks of the density.                          The algorithm only requires rough estimates of the density at the data points, and knowledge of (approximate) pairwise distances between them. It is therefore applicable in any metric space. Meanwhile, its complexity remains practical: although the size of the input distance matrix may be up to quadratic in the number of data points, a careful implementation only uses a linear amount of memory and takes barely more time to run than to read through the input.},

For global schemes, a graph Laplacian is used in a modified Newton iteration to speed up the local approach. Our work provides a mathematical foundation for a number of mesh smoothing schemes often used in practice, and leads to a new global mesh optimization scheme.

The classic Delaunay triangulation can then be characterized as an optimal triangulation that minimizes the interpolation error for the isotropie function {$\parallel$}x{$\parallel^2$} among all the triangulations with a given set of vertices. For a more general function, a functiondependent Delaunay triangulation is then defined to be an optimal triangulation that minimizes the interpolation error for this function and its construction can be obtained by a simple lifting and projection procedure. The optimal Delaunay triangulation is the one that minimizes the interpolation error among all triangulations with the same number of vertices, i.e. the distribution of vertices are optimized in order to minimize the interpolation error. Such a function-dependent optimal Delaunay triangulation is proved to exist for any given convex continuous function. On an optimal Delaunay triangulation associated with f, it is proved that {$\bigtriangledown$}f at the interior vertices can be exactly recovered by the function values on its neighboring vertices. Since the optimal Delaunay triangulation is difficult to obtain in practice, the concept of nearly optimal triangulation is introduced and two sufficient conditions are presented for a triangulation to be nearly optimal.},

  abstract = {The invention notably relates to a computer-implemented method for 3D reconstruction of a structure of a real scene. The method comprises providing a 3D point cloud representing the structure. The method further comprises determining a closed triangulated surface representing a skin of the structure. The determining explores candidate closed triangulated surfaces each meshing at least a respective part of the 3D point cloud. The determining penalizes a high rank of the candidate closed triangulated surfaces according to a lexicographic order. The lexicographic order is based on a triangle order. The lexicographic order orders a first candidate closed triangulated surface having first triangles which are ordered according to a decreasing rank of the triangle order, relative to a second candidate closed triangulated surface having second triangles which are ordered according to a decreasing rank of the triangle order. The triangle order penalizes a triangle size. This constitutes an improved method for 3D reconstruction of a structure of a real scene.},

This assumption stated that such scenes were built on a cartesian grid which led to regularities in the image edge gradient statistics. In this paper we explore the general applicability of this assumption and show that, surprisingly, it holds in a large variety of less structured environments including rural scenes. This enables us, from a single image, to determine the orientation of the viewer relative to the scene structure and also to detect target objects which are not aligned with the grid. These inferences are performed using a Bayesian model with probability distributions (e.g. on the image gradient statistics) learnt from real data.},

In our earlier work, we showed that computing minimal 1-dimensional persistent cycles (persistent 1-cycles) for finite intervals is NP-hard while the same for infinite intervals is polynomially tractable. In this paper, we address this problem for general dimensions with Z2 coefficients. In addition to proving that it is NP-hard to compute minimal persistent d-cycles (d {$>$} 1) for both types of intervals given arbitrary simplicial complexes, we identify two interesting cases which are polynomially tractable. These two cases assume the complex to be a certain generalization of manifolds which we term as weak pseudomanifolds. For finite intervals from the dth persistence diagram of a weak (d + 1)-pseudomanifold, we utilize the fact that persistent cycles of such intervals are null-homologous and reduce the problem to a minimal cut problem. Since the same problem for infinite intervals is NP-hard, we further assume the weak (d + 1)-pseudomanifold to be embedded in Rd+1 so that the complex has a natural dual graph structure and the problem reduces to a minimal cut problem. Experiments with both algorithms on scientific data indicate that the minimal persistent cycles capture various significant features of the data.},

  abstract = {Efficient computation of shortest cycles which form a homology basis under \$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$-additions in a given simplicial complex \$\textbackslash mathcal\{K\}\$ has been researched actively in recent years. When the complex \$\textbackslash mathcal\{K\}\$ is a weighted graph with \$n\$ vertices and \$m\$ edges, the problem of computing a shortest (homology) cycle basis is known to be solvable in \$O(m\^2n/\textbackslash log n+ n\^2m)\$-time. Several works \textbackslash cite\{borradaile2017minimum, greedy\} have addressed the case when the complex \$\textbackslash mathcal\{K\}\$ is a \$2\$-manifold. The complexity of these algorithms depends on the rank \$g\$ of the one-dimensional homology group of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{K\}\$. This rank \$g\$ has a lower bound of \$\textbackslash Theta(n)\$, where \$n\$ denotes the number of simplices in \$\textbackslash mathcal\{K\}\$, giving an \$O(n\^4)\$ worst-case time complexity for the algorithms in \textbackslash cite\{borradaile2017minimum,greedy\}. This worst-case complexity is improved in \textbackslash cite\{annotation\} to \$O(n\^\textbackslash omega + n\^2g\^\{\textbackslash omega-1\})\$ for general simplicial complexes where \$\textbackslash omega{$<$} 2.3728639\$ \textbackslash cite\{le2014powers\} is the matrix multiplication exponent. Taking \$g=\textbackslash Theta(n)\$, this provides an \$O(n\^\{\textbackslash omega+1\})\$ worst-case algorithm. In this paper, we improve this time complexity. Combining the divide and conquer technique from \textbackslash cite\{DivideConquer\} with the use of annotations from \textbackslash cite\{annotation\}, we present an algorithm that runs in \$O(n\^\textbackslash omega+n\^2g)\$ time giving the first \$O(n\^3)\$ worst-case algorithm for general complexes. If instead of minimal basis, we settle for an approximate basis, we can improve the running time even further. We show that a \$2\$-approximate minimal homology basis can be computed in \$O(n\^\{\textbackslash omega\}\textbackslash sqrt\{n \textbackslash log n\})\$ expected time. We also study more general measures for defining the minimal basis and identify reasonable conditions on these measures that allow computing a minimal basis efficiently.},

  abstract = {With the increasing point densities provided by airborne laser scanner (ALS) data the requirements on derived products also increase. One major application of ALS data is to provide input for 3D city models. Modeling of roof faces, (3D) road and terrain surfaces can partially be done in an automated manner, although many such approaches are still in a development stage. Problems in automatic building reconstruction lie in the dynamic area between assumptions and reality. Not every object in the data appears as the algorithm expects. Challenges are to detect areas that cannot be reconstructed automatically. This paper describes our contribution to the field of building reconstruction by proposing a target based graph matching approach that can handle both complete and incomplete laser data. Match results describe which target objects appear topologically in the data. Complete match results can be reconstructed in an automated manner. Quality parameters store information on how the model fits to the input data and which data has not been used. Areas where laser data only partly matches with target objects are detected automatically. Four datasets are analyzed in order to describe the quality of the automatically reconstructed roofs, and to point out the reasons why segments are left out from the automatic reconstruction. The reasons why these areas are left out include lack of data information and limitations of our initial target objects. Potential improvement to our approach is to include likelihood functions to the existence of topological relations.},

  abstract = {This textbook offers a statistical view on the geometry of multiple view analysis, required for camera calibration and orientation and for geometric scene reconstruction based on geometric image features. The authors have backgrounds in geodesy and also long experience with development and research in computer vision, and this is the first book to present a joint approach from the converging fields of photogrammetry and computer vision. Part I of the book provides an introduction to estimation theory, covering aspects such as Bayesian estimation, variance components, and sequential estimation, with a focus on the statistically sound diagnostics of estimation results essential in vision metrology. Part II provides tools for 2D and 3D geometric reasoning using projective geometry. This includes oriented projective geometry and tools for statistically optimal estimation and test of geometric entities and transformations and their rela-tions, tools that are useful also in the context of uncertain reasoning in point clouds. Part III is de-voted to modelling the geometry of single and multiple cameras, addressing calibration and orienta-tion, including statistical evaluation and reconstruction of corresponding scene features and surfaces based on geometric image features. The authors provide algorithms for various geometric computa-tion problems in vision metrology, together with mathematical justifications and statistical analysis, thus enabling thorough evaluations. The chapters are self-contained with numerous figures and exer-cises, and they are supported by an appendix that explains the basic mathematical notation and a de-tailed index. The book can serve as the basis for undergraduate and graduate courses in photogrammetry, com-puter vision, and computer graphics. It is also appropriate for researchers, engineers, and software developers in the photogrammetry and GIS industries, particularly those engaged with statistically based geometric computer vision methods},

We also present alternative characterizations of this primal-dual structure (through combinations of angles, areas, and lengths) and, in the process, uncover closed-form expressions of mesh energies that were previously known in implicit form only. Finally, we demonstrate how weighted triangulations provide a faster and more robust approach to a series of geometry processing applications, including the generation of well-centered meshes, self-supporting surfaces, and sphere packing.},

  abstract = {Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks have shown promising results for 3D geometry prediction. They can make predictions from very little input data such as a single color image. A major limitation of such approaches is that they only predict a coarse resolution voxel grid, which does not capture the surface of the objects well. We propose a general framework, called hierarchical surface prediction (HSP), which facilitates prediction of high resolution voxel grids. The main insight is that it is sufficient to predict high resolution voxels around the predicted surfaces. The exterior and interior of the objects can be represented with coarse resolution voxels. Our approach is not dependent on a specific input type. We show results for geometry prediction from color images, depth images and shape completion from partial voxel grids. Our analysis shows that our high resolution predictions are more accurate than low resolution predictions.},

Robust estimation methods such as RANSAC/MSAC, are applied to derive best fitting roof models in a model-driven way. For the identification of the most probable roof model, supervised machine learning methods (Support Vector Machines) are used. In contrast to standard approaches (where the best model is selected via MDL or AIC), supervised classification is able to incorporate additional features enabling a significant improvement in model selection accuracy.},

While previous techniques usually reconstruct surfaces as the zero level-set of a signed distance function, our method uses an unsigned distance function and hence does not require any information about the local surface orientation. Our algorithm estimates local surface confidence values within a dilated crust around the input samples. The surface which maximizes the global confidence is then extracted by computing the minimum cut of a weighted spatial graph structure. We present an algorithm, which efficiently converts this cut into a closed, manifold triangle mesh with a minimal number of vertices. The use of an unsigned distance function avoids the topological noise artifacts caused by misalignment of 3D scans, which are common to most volumetric reconstruction techniques. Due to a hierarchical approach our method efficiently produces solid models of low genus even for noisy and highly irregular data containing large holes, without loosing fine details in densely sampled regions. We show several examples for different application settings such as model generation from raw laser-scanned data, image-based 3D reconstruction, and mesh repair.},

However, most of the existing buildings have no BIM. Research in creating BIM for existing buildings has received growing attention in recent years. It is evident from current literature that generating BIM for existing building is complex, tedious, time consuming and costly. The objective of this project is to explore potential opportunities and barriers in constructing BIM for existing buildings. Different techniques used in capturing building data such as imaging, 3D scanning, Ground Penetration Radar (GPR), 2D scanned plans and so on, have their pros and cons in terms of high modelling/conversion efforts necessary to construct a semantically rich BIM. Moreover, most of these techniques are complex; require expert knowledge; core steps are still manual; face challenges in handling occlusions/uncertain data; and BIM conversion becomes cumbersome with the BIM's increasing level of detail (LoD). A systematic analysis is done on various techniques used in data capturing and how they are converted into a semantically rich BIM, accuracy of the converted model, interoperability of the generated BIM in terms of functionality, potential barriers in the automation process and how they can be overcome.},

This Poisson formulation considers all the points at once, without resorting to heuristic spatial partitioning or blending, and is therefore highly resilient to data noise. Unlike radial basis function schemes, our Poisson approach allows a hierarchy of locally supported basis functions, and therefore the solution reduces to a well conditioned sparse linear system. We describe a spatially adaptive multiscale algorithm whose time and space complexities are proportional to the size of the reconstructed model. Experimenting with publicly available scan data, we demonstrate reconstruction of surfaces with greater detail than previously achievable.},

  abstract = {Poisson surface reconstruction creates watertight surfaces from oriented point sets. In this work we extend the technique to explicitly incorporate the points as interpolation constraints. The extension can be interpreted as a generalization of the underlying mathematical framework to a screened Poisson equation. In contrast to other image and geometry processing techniques, the screening term is defined over a sparse set of points rather than over the full domain. We show that these sparse constraints can nonetheless be integrated efficiently. Because the modified linear system retains the same finite-element discretization, the sparsity structure is unchanged, and the system can still be solved using a multigrid approach. Moreover we present several algorithmic improvements that together reduce the time complexity of the solver to linear in the number of points, thereby enabling faster, higher-quality surface reconstructions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel algorithm for generating a watertight level-set from an octree. We show that the levelset can be efficiently extracted regardless of the topology of the octree or the values assigned to the vertices. The key idea behind our approach is the definition of a set of binary edge-trees derived from the octree's topology. We show that the edge-trees can be used define the positions of the isovalue-crossings in a consistent fashion and to resolve inconsistencies that may arise when a single edge has multiple isovalue-crossings. Using the edge-trees, we show that a provably watertight mesh can be extracted from the octree without necessitating the refinement of nodes or modification of their values.},

We consider the problem of finding critical points of a broad class of non-convex problems with non-smooth components. We analyze the behavior of two gradient-based methods\textemdash namely a sub-gradient method, and a proximal method. Our main results are to establish rates of convergence for general problems, and also exhibit faster rates for sub-analytic functions. As an application of our theory, we obtain a simplification of the popular CCCP algorithm, which retains all the desirable convergence properties of the original method, along with a significantly lower cost per iteration. We illustrate our methods and theory via application to the problems of best subset selection, robust estimation, and shape from shading reconstruction.},

Geometric 3D-primitives such as planes, cylinders, spheres or cones describe regular roof sections, and are combined with mesh-patches that represent irregular roof components. The various urban components interact through a non-convex energy minimization problem in which they are propagated under arrangement constraints over a planimetric map. Our approach is experimentally validated on complex buildings and large urban scenes of millions of points, and is compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

The method provides a compact model while preserving details: irregular elements such as statues and ornaments are described by meshes whereas regular structures such as columns and walls are described by primitives (planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori). We adopt a two-step strategy consisting first in segmenting the initial meshbased surface using a multi-label Markov Random Field based model and second, in sampling primitive and mesh components simultaneously on the obtained partition by a Jump-Diffusion process. The quality of a reconstruction is measured by a multi-object energy model which takes into account both photo-consistency and semantic considerations (i.e. geometry and shape layout). The segmentation and sampling steps are embedded into an iterative refinement procedure which provides an increasingly accurate hybrid representation. Experimental results on complex urban structures and large scenes are presented and compared to the state-of-the-art multi-view stereo meshing algorithms.},

With image-based approaches utilizing Structure from Motion (SfM), high-resolution Digital Surface Models (DSM), and orthophotos can be generated efficiently using UAV imagery. However, image-based mapping yields relatively poor results in low textured areas as compared to those from LiDAR. This study demonstrates the applicability of UAV LiDAR for mapping coastal environments. A custom-built UAV-based mobile mapping system is used to simultaneously collect LiDAR and imagery data. The quality of LiDAR, as well as image-based point clouds, are investigated and compared over different geomorphic environments in terms of their point density, relative and absolute accuracy, and area coverage. The results suggest that both UAV LiDAR and image-based techniques provide high-resolution and high-quality topographic data, and the point clouds generated by both techniques are compatible within a 5 to 10 cm range. UAV LiDAR has a clear advantage in terms of large and uniform ground coverage over different geomorphic environments, higher point density, and ability to penetrate through vegetation to capture points below the canopy. Furthermore, UAV LiDAR-based data acquisitions are assessed for their applicability in monitoring shoreline changes over two actively eroding sandy beaches along southern Lake Michigan, Dune Acres, and Beverly Shores, through repeated field surveys. The results indicate a considerable volume loss and ridge point retreat over an extended period of one year (May 2018 to May 2019) as well as a short storm-induced period of one month (November 2018 to December 2018). The foredune ridge recession ranges from 0 m to 9 m. The average volume loss at Dune Acres is 18.2 cubic meters per meter and 12.2 cubic meters per meter within the one-year period and storm-induced period, respectively, highlighting the importance of episodic events in coastline changes. The average volume loss at Beverly Shores is 2.8 cubic meters per meter and 2.6 cubic meters per meter within the survey period and storm-induced period, respectively.},

The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data.

Wavelets provide a localized, multiresolution representation of functions and this makes them ideal candidates for streaming surface reconstruction algorithms. We show how wavelets can be used to reconstruct the indicator function of a shape from a cloud of points with associated normals. Our method proceeds in several steps. We first compute a low-resolution approximation of the indicator function using an octree followed by a second pass that incrementally adds fine resolution details. The indicator function is then smoothed using a modified octree convolution step and contoured to produce the final surface. Due to the local, multiresolution nature of wavelets, our approach results in an algorithm over 10 times faster than previous methods and can process extremely large data sets in the order of several hundred million points in only an hour.},

However, unlike for images, in 3D there is no canonical representation which is both computationally and memory efficient yet allows for representing high-resolution geometry of arbitrary topology. Many of the state-of-the-art learning-based 3D reconstruction approaches can hence only represent very coarse 3D geometry or are limited to a restricted domain. In this paper, we propose Occupancy Networks, a new representation for learning-based 3D reconstruction methods. Occupancy networks implicitly represent the 3D surface as the continuous decision boundary of a deep neural network classifier. In contrast to existing approaches, our representation encodes a description of the 3D output at infinite resolution without excessive memory footprint. We validate that our representation can efficiently encode 3D structure and can be inferred from various kinds of input. Our experiments demonstrate competitive results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the challenging tasks of 3D reconstruction from single images, noisy point clouds and coarse discrete voxel grids. We believe that occupancy networks will become a useful tool in a wide variety of learning-based 3D tasks.},

  abstract = {Existing 3D surface representation approaches are unable to accurately classify pixels and their orientation lying on the boundary of an object. Thus resulting in coarse representations which usually require post-processing steps to extract 3D surface meshes. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end trainable model that directly predicts implicit surface representations of arbitrary topology by optimising a novel geometric loss function. Specifically, we propose to represent the output as an oriented level set of a continuous embedding function, and incorporate this in a deep end-to-end learning framework by introducing a variational shape inference formulation. We investigate the benefits of our approach on the task of 3D surface prediction and demonstrate its ability to produce a more accurate reconstruction compared to voxel-based representations. We further show that our model is flexible and can be applied to a variety of shape inference problems.},

  abstract = {Reconstructing the as-built architectural shape of building interiors has emerged in recent years as an important and challenging research problem. An effective approach must be able to faithfully capture the architectural structures and separate permanent components from clutter e.g. furniture, while at the same time dealing with defects in the input data. For many applications, higher-level information on the environment is also required, in particular the shape of individual rooms. To solve this ill-posed problem, state-of-the-art methods assume constrained input environments with a 2.5D or, more restrictively, a Manhattan-world structure, which significantly restricts their applicability in real-world settings. We present a novel pipeline that allows to reconstruct general 3D interior architectures, significantly increasing the range of real-world architectures that can be reconstructed and labeled by any interior reconstruction method to date. Our method finds candidate permanent components by reasoning on a graph-based scene representation, then uses them to build a 3D linear cell complex that is partitioned into separate rooms through a multi-label energy minimization formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to a variety of real-world and synthetic datasets and by comparing it to more specialized state-of-the-art approaches.},

The Delaunay triangulation of S is corresponding to a vertex of the secondary polytope of S. We proposed an algorithm for DT's construction, where the parabolic functional and the secondary polytope are used. Finally, we considered a discrete analog of the Dirichlet functional. DT is optimal for this functional only in two dimensions.},

In essence, SfM involves the three main stages of (1) extraction of features in images (e.g., points of interest, lines, etc.) and matching these features between images, (2) camera motion estimation (e.g., using relative pairwise camera positions estimated from the extracted features), and (3) recovery of the \$3\$D structure using the estimated motion and features (e.g., by minimizing the so-called reprojection error). This survey mainly focuses on relatively recent developments in the literature pertaining to stages (2) and (3). More specifically, after touching upon the early factorization-based techniques for motion and structure estimation, we provide a detailed account of some of the recent camera location estimation methods in the literature, followed by discussion of notable techniques for \$3\$D structure recovery. We also cover the basics of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, which can be viewed as a specific case of the SfM problem. Further, our survey includes a review of the fundamentals of feature extraction and matching (i.e., stage (1) above), various recent methods for handling ambiguities in \$3\$D scenes, SfM techniques involving relatively uncommon camera models and image features, and popular sources of data and SfM software.},

In this work, we introduce DeepSDF, a learned continuous Signed Distance Function (SDF) representation of a class of shapes that enables high quality shape representation, interpolation and completion from partial and noisy 3D input data. DeepSDF, like its classical counterpart, represents a shape's surface by a continuous volumetric field: the magnitude of a point in the field represents the distance to the surface boundary and the sign indicates whether the region is inside (-) or outside (+) of the shape, hence our representation implicitly encodes a shape's boundary as the zero-level-set of the learned function while explicitly representing the classification of space as being part of the shapes interior or not. While classical SDF's both in analytical or discretized voxel form typically represent the surface of a single shape, DeepSDF can represent an entire class of shapes. Furthermore, we show state-of-the-art performance for learned 3D shape representation and completion while reducing the model size by an order of magnitude compared with previous work.},

We describe and classify possible regular structures and present an effective algorithm for detecting such repeated geometric patterns in point- or meshbased models. Our method assumes no prior knowledge of the geometry or spatial location of the individual elements that define the pattern. Structure discovery is made possible by a careful analysis of pairwise similarity transformations that reveals prominent lattice structures in a suitable model of transformation space. We introduce an optimization method for detecting such uniform grids specifically designed to deal with outliers and missing elements. This yields a robust algorithm that successfully discovers complex regular structures amidst clutter, noise, and missing geometry. The accuracy of the extracted generating transformations is further improved using a novel simultaneous registration method in the spatial domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on a variety of examples and show applications to compression, model repair, and geometry synthesis.},

In addition, we show some results of automatic segmentation and classification. The dataset is available at: http://caor-mines-paristech.fr/fr/paris-lille-3d-dataset/ .},

The technique utilizes the point samples not only for local surface position estimation but also to obtain global visibility information under the assumption that each acquired point is visible from a point lying outside the shape. This enables associating each point with a generalized cone, called the               visibility cone               , that carves a portion of the outside ambient space of the shape from the inside out. These cones collectively provide a means to better approximate the signed distances to the shape specifically near regions containing large holes in the scan, allowing one to infer the correct surface topology. Combining the new distance measure with conventional RBF, we define an implicit function whose zero level set defines the surface of the shape. We demonstrate the utility of cone carving in coping with significant missing data and raw scans from a commercial 3D scanner as well as synthetic input.},

This information has traditionally been estimated on the basis of limited population or employment data provided by the census, with unknown accuracy. Advances in geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technology enable the accuracy of this conventional method to be evaluated with geographic data of high precision. This study assessed the accuracy of the census-based approach in estimating base-year floor space data; the paper describes the use of a hybrid method that combines lidar and geographic vector data (referred to as the ``lidar-GIS method'') to develop a ground truth building floor space database for the City of Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. A ground survey proved that the developed ground truth building data set provided highly accurate estimates of building heights, footprint areas, and therefore floor space. Through a case study, the floor space at the dissemination area level estimated with the traditional census-based method was compared with the floor space estimated with the lidar-GIS method for various land use categories. The results showed that for the residential floor space estimation, the average absolute percentage error of the census-based approach was 15\%. The accuracy of the conventional method was much lower for nonresidential land use categories, with average errors of 50\% or higher. These statistics indicate that the traditional census-based approach is unreliable and inaccurate for use in the estimation of base-year floor space and suggests that a method that incorporates the above-mentioned modern information technologies be used.},

This article presents the essential algorithms and techniques used to develop TetGen. The intended audience are researchers or developers in mesh generation or other related areas. It describes the key software components of TetGen, including an efficient tetrahedral mesh data structure, a set of enhanced local mesh operations (combination of flips and edge removal), and filtered exact geometric predicates. The essential algorithms include incremental Delaunay algorithms for inserting vertices, constrained Delaunay algorithms for inserting constraints (edges and triangles), a new edge recovery algorithm for recovering constraints, and a new constrained Delaunay refinement algorithm for adaptive quality tetrahedral mesh generation. Experimental examples as well as comparisons with other softwares are presented.},

We propose a functional distinction between tasks: those that require shape understanding versus those that require precise judgments of relative position. The distortions inherent in 3D displays hamper judging relative positions, whereas the integration of dimensions in 3D displays facilitates shape understanding. We confirmed these hypotheses with two initial experiments involving simple block shapes. The shape-understanding tasks were identification or mental rotation. The relative-position tasks were locating shadows and determining directions and distances between objects. We then extended the results to four experiments involving complex natural terrain. We compare our distinction with the integral/separable task distinction of Haskel and Wickens (1993). Applications for this research include displays for air traffic control, geoplots for military command and control, and potentially, any display of 3D information.},

Starting from raw datasets such as surface meshes generated by multiview stereo systems, our algorithm proceeds in three main steps: classification, abstraction, and reconstruction. From geometric attributes and a set of semantic rules combined with a Markov random field, we classify the scene into four meaningful classes. The abstraction step detects and regularizes planar structures on buildings, fits icons on trees, roofs, and facades, and performs filtering and simplification for LOD generation. The abstracted data are then provided as input to the reconstruction step which generates watertight buildings through a min-cut formulation on a set of 3D arrangements. Our experiments on complex buildings and large-scale urban scenes show that our approach generates meaningful LODs while being robust and scalable. By combining semantic segmentation and abstraction, it also outperforms general mesh approximation approaches at preserving urban structures.},

  abstract = {In cardiac image analysis, it is important yet challenging to reconstruct the trabeculae, namely, fine muscle columns whose ends are attached to the ventricular walls. To extract these fine structures, traditional image segmentation methods are insufficient. In this paper, we propose a novel method to jointly detect salient topological handles and compute the optimal representations of them. The detected handles are considered hypothetical trabeculae structures. They are further screened using a classifier and are then included in the final segmentation. We show in experiments the significance of our contribution compared with previous standard segmentation methods without topological priors, as well as with previous topological method in which non-optimal representations of topological handles are used.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an automatic algorithm which reconstructs building models from airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data of urban areas. While our algorithm inherits the typical building reconstruction pipeline, several major distinct features are developed to enhance efficiency and robustness: 1) we design a novel vegetation detection algorithm based on differential geometry properties and unbalanced SVM; 2) after roof patch segmentation, a fast boundary extraction method is introduced to produce topology-correct water tight boundaries; 3) instead of making assumptions on the angles between roof boundary lines, we propose a data-driven algorithm which automatically learns the principal directions of roof boundaries and uses them in footprint production. Furthermore, we show the extendability of our algorithm by supporting non-flat object patterns with the help of only a few user interactions. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm by showing experiment results on urban area data of several different data sets.},
